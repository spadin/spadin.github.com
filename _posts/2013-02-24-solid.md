### Single Responsibility Principle

Every class should have a single responsibility. A responsibility is
defined as a reason to change.

Take the following example (adapted from this [SRP in Ruby article][3]):

    # employee.rb
    class Employee
      def set_hours(hours)
      ...
      end
      def calculate_pay
      ...
      end
    end

The Employee class is calculating the pay and accepts the number of
hours an employee works. Those are two separate responsibilities.

This change would assure each file has only a single responsibility.

    # employee_time.rb
    class EmployeeTime
      def set_hours(hours)
      ...
      end
    end

    # employee_pay.rb
    class EmployeePay
      def calculate_pay
      ...
      end
    end

    # employee.rb
    require 'employee_time'
    require 'employee_pay'

    class Employee
      include EmployeeTime
      include EmployeePay
    end

### Open/closed Principle

You should be able to extend a class' behavior without modifying the
class.

### Liskov Substitution Principle

Derived classes should be substitutable for their base classes.

### Interface Segregation Principle

Make fine grained classes that are client specific.

### Dependency Inversion Principle

Depend on abstractions, not concretions.
