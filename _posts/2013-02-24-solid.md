_This post will be edited as I learn more about SOLID. For
information from more authoritative sources check the
[references](#references) below._

### Single Responsibility Principle

Every class should have a single responsibility. A responsibility is
defined as a reason to change.

### Open/closed Principle

You should be able to extend a class' behavior without modifying the
class.

### Liskov Substitution Principle

Derived classes should be substitutable for their base classes.

### Interface Segregation Principle

Make fine grained classes that are client specific.

### Dependency Inversion Principle

Depend on abstractions, not concretions.
