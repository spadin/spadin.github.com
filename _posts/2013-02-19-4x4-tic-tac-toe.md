I spent the majority of the day determining how I should add the 4x4
game to my implementation. As far as I can tell there are three major
parts that change: the rules, printer and board. I will likely convert
these to protocols and define types for them. I'm interested in seeing
how I can refactor my code effectively and reduce bugs from simple copy
and paste mistakes. 

I'll post updates this week with my findings. I'll also be posting about
[SOLID][1] this week in preparation of "teaching" Micah about the subject.
