I really can't thank Rick enough for once again spending a good half
hour, if not more, helping me with this algorithm. I can finally see the
light at the end of the tunnel. 

My implementation of the alpha beta pruning search still has some bugs,
but I feel confident I've modeled the function well enough to fix the
bugs with relative ease. I'm hoping I can finish this up tomorrow
morning. 

The next step is implementing  an easy AI. This should only take me
about half a day so hopefully I can make up some of the time I lost
implementing Minimax.
