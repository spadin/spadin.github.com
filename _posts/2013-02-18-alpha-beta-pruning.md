After a week of struggling with the implementation, I finally got
Minimax with alpha-beta pruning working.

I found it difficult to debug my code. I had some print statements
peppered throughout the code but with the recursive nature of this
algorithm, it was tough to really step through the code in order to
determine where my bugs were. It took a combination of print statements
and working through the code by hand for me to finally figure out what
was going wrong, missing return variables.

While the process was tedious, I can appreciate having gone through it.
Now I can confidently say I understand the Minimax algorithm and the
alpha-beta pruning aspect of it as well. 

Now on to my next task of creating a 4x4 board and a 3x3x3 game.
