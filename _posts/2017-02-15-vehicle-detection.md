title: Vehicle Detection
description: Wrote a software pipeline to detect vehicles in a video from a front-facing camera on a car. Evaluated several colorspaces to find best results. Used histogram of gradients to extract features. Trained a model using a linear support vector machine. Then using a sliding window approach allowed the model to detect vehicles in each video frame.

### Project description

Wrote a software pipeline to detect vehicles in a video from a front-facing
camera on a car. Evaluated several colorspaces to find best results. Used
histogram of gradients to extract features. Trained a model using a linear
support vector machine. Then using a sliding window approach allowed the model
to detect vehicles in each video frame.
