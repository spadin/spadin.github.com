      <h1>Week One at 8th Light</h1>
      <h2>One fun week learning Clojure and putting what I learned into use by making a Tic Tac Toe game</h2>
    </header>
    <p>It’s been a great first week at 8th Light as a Resident Apprentice. I
started the week by performing the <a href="http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheBowlingGameKata">bowling game kata</a> in Java for <a href="http://www.8thlight.com/our-team/micah-martin">Micah</a> with
Rick, a fellow apprentice. I enjoyed practicing the kata last weekend,
but it still took me 15 minutes to perform which was 5 minutes shy of
my 10 minute goal. I realized if I want to get my time down I don’t just need to
type faster, but really get familiar with IntelliJ IDEA to take advantage of all
the keyboard shortcuts it offers. I hadn’t programmed in Java in quite a few
years, and I was happily surprised to find a new feature (to me)
called annotations. From Wikipedia, “An annotation, in the Java
computer programming language, is a form of syntactic metadata that
can be added to Java source code.” In short, annotations let you add
information about the source code. I noticed annoations while using JUnit,
the tests are marked with an <code>@Test</code> annotation.</p>

<p>I’ve spent the majority of this week learning Clojure and making a 
command-line Tic Tac Toe game. The process has been rewarding and 
frustrating at the same time. I call the project <a href="https://github.com/spadin/ticlj">Ticlj</a>, although 
I’m planning to change the name to <a href="https://github.com/spadin/ticlj">TicljTacToe</a> soon. I wrote the 
basic human vs human game in a few days, but after talking to Micah, I 
learned the way I coded my program had imperative programming qualities rather 
than being purely functional; I kept a reference to the Tic Tac Toe board and 
I was changing the reference to point at other iterations of the board via <code>ref</code> 
and <code>ref-set</code> calls.</p>

<p>I took some time today to refactor my game into being purely
functional. In order to do so, I had to change about 15 or so
functions to accept a new <code>board</code> argument. By doing so, the reference
to the board was no longer necessary, so now my Tic Tac Toe game has no
mutable state.</p>

<p>I’m very happy with what I’ve been able to accomplish this week.
Clojure has actually been a nice language to work with, aside from the
initial shock over the incredible number of parenthesis, the language
is simple and succint.</p>

<p>Thanks to Micah, Rick, Ryan and Rylan for helping me wrap my head
around functional programming principles. After a long time of not thinking
about it, the principles of functional programming were a little
confusing, but I think I have a good grasp on it.</p>

<p>On a separate note, I noticed some interesting books on design
patterns and TDD in the 8th Light library and I plan to take a closer 
look next week.</p>

<h3 id="things-to-accomplish-next-week">Things to accomplish next week:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Complete the AI for my <a href="https://github.com/spadin/ticlj">Tic Tac Toe game.</a></li>
  <li>Finish the full <a href="https://github.com/spadin/ticlj">Tic Tac Toe game.</a></li>
  <li>Read a book from the 8th Light library.</li>
