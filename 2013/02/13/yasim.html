      <h2>Yet Another Day Implementing Minimax</h2>
    </header>
    <p>I spent the day trying to implement the alpha-beta pruning search 
algorithm. I’m not sure why it’s taking me so long to learn this algorithm. 
Rick was kind enough to walk me through the algorithm as he understands 
it this afternoon which was very helpful.</p>

<p>My major blockng point is visualizing the algorithm in the context of my
Clojure Tic Tac Toe game. I’ve read several articles on this algorithm
and on their own they make sense, but when I try to apply what I learn to 
my game I get stuck. I feel I’m very close though and since this is the most 
important part of my game the time I’m investing learning this algorithm 
is well worth it.</p>

<p>This afternoon Corey Haines stopped by and hung out for a little bit.
He was kind enough to give Rick and I his thoughts on Minimax and a
different approach to thinking about the board and the moves. Rick
mentioned that he was thinking of doing a kata on his Java server, and
asked Corey his thoughts on how to approach the test for kata. Corey went 
on the whiteboard and gave some interesting ideas for that as well. I
haven’t gotten to the Java server yet, but it was still interesting to
hear their thoughts on the topic.</p>
